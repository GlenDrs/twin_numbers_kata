# Twin Primes Kata!

### This kata can be accounted as a Kuy 5 or 6 level.
### The question is simple: Given an interval [A:B] you should find all the twin primes included in the interval.

*Twin Primes are all the prime numbers that have an absolute difference of two between each other*

For example in the interval between 2 and 25 [^1] the **twin primes** are: 3-5, 5-7, 11-13 and 17-19.


[^1]: The 2 and the 25 are included in the interval.
